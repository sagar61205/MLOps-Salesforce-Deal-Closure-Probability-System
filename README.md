<h4>üìä The Business Problem:</h4>

<ul><li>Rep-entered confidence was about 41‚Äì44%, while actual closed leads landed around 30‚Äì32%, which led to planning gaps and surprise revenue misses across fiscal periods.</li>
<li>Because estimates were manual, pipeline reviews were inconsistent, making quota setting, territory planning, and resource allocation harder quarter to quarter.</li>
<li>The directive was to replace subjective guesses with calibrated, sequence‚Äëaware probabilities that reflect how deals actually move through sales stages.</li>
</ul>

<h4>üìä My role and the solution:</h4>
As the Data Scientist on this project, the mandate was to replace subjective, late-stage rep estimates with an objective, sequence‚Äëaware forecasting system. Built an end‚Äëto‚Äëend ML pipeline that 
analyzes stage progressions and opportunity signals to predict lead closure months earlier, 
giving sales leaders a calibrated, reality‚Äëaligned confidence score for planning and action.
<br>

<h4>Business Impact:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Forecast bias reduction(80%): Reduced absolute forecast error from 10 percentage points (rep 41% vs. actual 31%) to 2 percentage points (model 32% vs. actual 30%) ‚Äî an 80% error reduction.</li>
<li>Delivered 5 times smaller error than reps (2 pp vs. 10 pp), materially tightening forecast accuracy.</li>
<li>Early signal advantage: 12-months earlier prediction than the typical 1‚Äì2 month notice from reps, enabling earlier sales decisions, territory shifts, and resource planning.</li>
<li>Revenue-based decision making using an end-to-end deployed solution on GCP using Vertex AI(Docker and AIrflow DAGs).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reps vs Model vs actual probabilities:</h4>

<h5>Major Challenge: Non-Linear and Variable Sales Cycles:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Sales deals didn't follow a straight line. They often jumped back and forth between stages or moved at wildly different speeds. This messy data made it hard for the model to learn what a typical path to "win" or "loss" looked like.</li>  
</ul>

<h5>Solution: Strategic Data Filtration and a Focused Learning Objective:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Curated Training Data: Instead of training the model on all available opportunities, we filtered the dataset to include only those that demonstrated a clear progression pattern.</li>
<li>Clarified Learning Goal: This filtration allowed the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to focus on learning the essential transition probabilities between stages that ahighly indicate the final outcome.</li>  
</ul>


<h5>Key Objectives:</h5>
<ul><li>Build an objective lead-closing predictor driven by stage‚Äësequence behavior rather than rep confidence fields.</li>
<li>Enforce strict sequence filtration (start at 'State 1' or 'State 2'; terminal labels lost/closed) and report results on both strict validation and all leads.</li>
<li>Refactor research code into 5 modules plus main.py, add Dockerfile, and make tasks CLI‚Äëdriven for train/evaluate/score for MLOps integration.</li>
<li>Orchestrate training and batch scoring with Airflow (Nitro dx template) using Harbor‚Äëhosted images and GCP storage.</li>
<li>Compare model probabilities vs. rep confidence across fiscal years and ship to production on GCP Vertex AI.</li>
<li>Build an end-to-end MLOps pipeline on GCP (Vertex AI, Docker, Airflow) to operationalize sequence‚Äëaware win‚Äëprobability forecasts, replacing subjective estimates with calibrated, reality‚Äëaligned signals.</li>  
</ul>
